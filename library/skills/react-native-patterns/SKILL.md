# React Native & Expo Patterns

## Expo Router

- Use file-based routing in the `app/` directory exclusively.
- Never co-locate components, types, or utilities in the `app/` directory — keep them in `src/`.
- Always ensure a route matches `/` (may be inside a group route).
- Use layout routes (`_layout.tsx`) for shared navigation UI (tabs, stacks, drawers).
- Remove old route files immediately when restructuring navigation.
- Use kebab-case for file names: `comment-card.tsx`.

## Styling with NativeWind

- Use NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native) as the primary styling method.
- Use `className` prop like web Tailwind — NativeWind compiles to StyleSheet.
- Use `cn()` helper for conditional classes.
- Prefer `useWindowDimensions` over `Dimensions.get()` for responsive layouts.
- Use flexbox exclusively for layout — avoid absolute positioning except for overlays.

## Running the App

- **Always try Expo Go first** before creating custom builds (`npx expo start`).
- Only use `npx expo run:ios/android` when custom native modules are required.
- Expo Go supports: all `expo-*` packages, Expo Router, Reanimated, Gesture Handler.

## Components

- Use functional components only — never class components.
- Use `expo-image` instead of React Native's `Image` — better caching and performance.
- Use `expo-image` with `source="sf:name"` for SF Symbols icons — not `@expo/vector-icons`.
- Use `react-native-safe-area-context` — never React Native's built-in `SafeAreaView`.
- Use `<ScrollView contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="automatic" />` instead of `<SafeAreaView>` for root scrolling.
- Use `process.env.EXPO_OS` instead of `Platform.OS`.
- Use `React.use` instead of `React.useContext`.

## Navigation

- Use Expo Router's typed routes for type-safe navigation.
- Handle deep linking and universal links from project start.
- Use native tabs (`NativeTabs`) for iOS tab navigation when possible.
- Preload frequently accessed screens for faster navigation.

## Performance

- **Profile before optimizing** — measure with React DevTools and Xcode Instruments.
- Replace `ScrollView` with `FlashList` (not `FlatList`) for large lists.
- Use React Compiler for automatic memoization when available.
- Avoid barrel exports — import directly from source files to reduce bundle size.
- Keep JS thread work minimal — offload to native with Turbo Modules when needed.
- Target 60fps — never block the JS thread with heavy computation.
- Use `useDeferredValue` for expensive computations during rendering.

## Animations

- Use `react-native-reanimated` for performant animations on the UI thread.
- Animate only `transform` and `opacity` — avoid animating layout properties.
- Use shared values and worklets for gesture-driven animations.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting.

## Offline & Storage

- Use `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` or `react-native-mmkv` for local key-value storage.
- Use `expo-sqlite` for structured offline data.
- Implement optimistic updates for network operations.
- Cache critical data locally for offline-first experience.

## Push Notifications

- Use `expo-notifications` for push notification setup.
- Request permission at a contextual moment — never on first launch.
- Handle notification responses (tap, dismiss) in the app root.
- Store push tokens in your backend database, linked to user profiles.

## App Distribution

- Use EAS Build for creating production builds.
- Use EAS Submit for app store submissions.
- Configure `app.json` / `app.config.ts` thoroughly: icons, splash, permissions, version.
- Test on both iOS and Android — never assume platform parity.
